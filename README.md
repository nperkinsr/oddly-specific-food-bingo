# Oddly specific food bingo
*Bingo: Oddly Specific Foods* is a deliciously absurd twist on the classic bingo game. Instead of numbers, the bingo cards are filled with bizarrely specific food items like "Shrimp applesauce" or "Worm salad."

The game includes a host module â€” a simple interface where the host clicks a button to draw and display one food item at a time. Players follow along with their own bingo cards until someone calls out "Bingo!"

This project was made to practise modular code structure, arrays, random selection without repetition, and basic game logic.
